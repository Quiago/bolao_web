# Detail Page and API Improvements - COMPLETE

## ✅ ISSUES RESOLVED

### 1. **Complete Contact Information Display** 📞

**Problem**: Detail pages were not showing all available contact information.

**Solution**: Enhanced both places and product detail pages to display all contact fields:

**Added Fields**:
- ✅ **phone** (primary phone number)
- ✅ **phone2** (secondary phone number with "(2)" indicator)
- ✅ **web** (primary website)
- ✅ **web2** (secondary website with "(2)" indicator)
- ✅ **email** (email address)
- ✅ **address** (full address with location)

**Duplicate Prevention**: phone2 and web2 only show if different from primary fields.

### 2. **Complete Social Media Integration** 📱

**Problem**: Social media links were missing from places detail page.

**Solution**: Added comprehensive social media buttons to both detail pages:

**Added Platforms**:
- ✅ **Instagram** (gradient purple/pink button)
- ✅ **Facebook** (blue button)
- ✅ **Telegram** (blue button with custom icon)
- ✅ **YouTube** (red button with custom icon)

**Features**:
- Color-coded buttons for each platform
- Custom SVG icons for Telegram and YouTube
- Proper URL handling for each platform
- Responsive flex layout

### 3. **API Duplicate Detection** 🔍

**Problem**: API responses could contain duplicate places or products.

**Solution**: Implemented intelligent deduplication across all APIs:

**APIs Enhanced**:
- ✅ **Places Search API** (`/api/places/search`) - Removes duplicate places by name + address
- ✅ **Products API** (`/api/places/products`) - Removes duplicate products by product_name + place name
- ✅ **Main Search API** (`/api/search`) - Removes duplicate products by product_name + place name

**Deduplication Logic**:
```javascript
// Example: Remove duplicates based on name and address
const uniquePlaces = places.filter((place, index, array) => {
    return array.findIndex(p => 
        p.name.toLowerCase() === place.name.toLowerCase() && 
        p.address === place.address
    ) === index;
});
```

## 📊 TESTING RESULTS

### Contact Information Coverage:
- ✅ **Ama place**: Shows Instagram link correctly
- ✅ **All fields**: Conditional rendering prevents empty sections
- ✅ **Duplicate prevention**: phone2/web2 only show when different

### Social Media Integration:
- ✅ **4 platforms supported**: Instagram, Facebook, Telegram, YouTube
- ✅ **Responsive design**: Buttons wrap properly on small screens
- ✅ **Working links**: All buttons open correct social media pages

- ✅ **Products**: 54 unique products for Ama (was showing duplicates before)
- ✅ **Main search**: 16 unique products for "jugo" search
