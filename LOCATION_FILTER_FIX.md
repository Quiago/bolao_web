# Location Filter Fix Documentation

## Problem Identified

When users select "Lugares" mode and use the location filter, the filtering was not working correctly because:

1. **Inconsistent Column Usage**: The filters API was loading location options from both `address` and `location` columns, but the search API was only filtering by the `location` column.

2. **Data Structure Issue**: Some places in the database have data in the `address` field but not in the `location` field, causing them to be missed when filtering.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Fixed Places Search API (`/pages/api/places/search.js`)

**Before:**

```javascript
// Only searched in location column
searchQuery = searchQuery.ilike('location', `%${location}%`);
```

**After:**

```javascript
// Searches in both location and address columns
searchQuery = searchQuery.or(`location.ilike.%${location}%,address.ilike.%${location}%`);
```

This change was applied to both:

- Regular search queries (line ~90)
- "Ver todos" queries (line ~25)

### 2. Improved Filters API (`/pages/api/filters.js`)

**Before:**

```javascript
// Mixed address and location values indiscriminately
const uniqueLocations = [...new Set([
    ...places.map(p => p.address).filter(addr => addr && addr.trim().length > 0),
    ...places.map(p => p.location).filter(loc => loc && loc.trim().length > 0)
])].sort();
```

**After:**

```javascript
// Prioritizes location field, falls back to address if location is empty
const locationValues = places.map(p => {
    return p.location && p.location.trim() ? p.location.trim() : 
           (p.address && p.address.trim() ? p.address.trim() : null);
}).filter(loc => loc && loc.length > 0);

const uniqueLocations = [...new Set(locationValues)].sort();
```

## Key Improvements

1. **Consistent Filtering**: Now both the filter options and search functionality use the same logic for location matching.

2. **Comprehensive Search**: Location filters now search in both `location` and `address` columns, ensuring no places are missed.

3. **Prioritized Data**: The filters API now prioritizes the `location` field over `address` when both are available, reducing duplicate entries.

4. **Better Performance**: Optimized the location extraction logic to avoid unnecessary duplicates.

## Expected Behavior After Fix

1. **Filter Options**: When in "Lugares" mode, the location dropdown will show unique location values, preferring the `location` field when available.

2. **Search Results**: When a location filter is applied, the search will find places that have the filter term in either their `location` OR `address` field.

3. **Consistency**: The same places that appear in filter options will be found when those filters are applied.

## Test Cases

To verify the fix works:

1. Switch to "Lugares" mode
2. Select a location from the dropdown (e.g., "Habana")
3. Search for any term (e.g., "restaurant")
4. Verify that results are filtered by the selected location
5. Check that places with the location in either `address` or `location` columns are included

## Files Modified

- `/pages/api/places/search.js`: Updated location filtering logic
- `/pages/api/filters.js`: Improved location option extraction
- `/test-location-filter-fixed.sh`: Created comprehensive test script

## Status

âœ… **FIXED** - Location filtering now works correctly in "Lugares" mode, searching both location and address columns for comprehensive results.
